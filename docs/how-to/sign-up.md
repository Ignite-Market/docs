# How to: Sign Up

## Sign up with wallet

Below is a quick walkthrough of how to create your Ignite Market account by connecting an EVM-compatible wallet such as MetaMask.

### Before you start

- Install a supported browser wallet extension (e.g. **MetaMask**, **Coinbase Wallet**, or **WalletConnect**).
- Switch the wallet network to the **Flare** network.

### Step-by-step

1. **Open the Ignite Market app.** Navigate to [https://ignitemarket.xyz](https://ignitemarket.xyz) in your browser.
2. **Click "Log In".**The button is located in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.
3. **Confirm that you are human.**
4. **Choose your wallet provider.**A modal will prompt you to pick MetaMask, WalletConnect, or another supported option.
4. **Approve the connection.**Your wallet will ask you to grant the site permission to view your address.
5. **Sign the registration message.**After connecting, Ignite Market generates a one-time, gas-free signature request. Signing it proves you own the address and finalizes your account creation.
6. **You're in!**Once the signature is confirmed, your wallet address will appear in the nav bar and you'll be able to deposit funds, trade, and create markets.

No email or password is required—your wallet **is** your account.

## Sign up with embedded wallet

Ignite Market lets you create a non-custodial wallet on the fly using popular social accounts (Discord, Google, Apple, and more). The wallet is powered by **Thirdweb Embedded Wallet** technology and is end-to-end encrypted—no seed phrase, password, or passkey required.

### Before you start

- Make sure you have access to one of the supported social providers you'd like to use (e.g. **Discord** or **Google**).
- If you already have a browser wallet (MetaMask, etc.), there's no need to disable it—the embedded wallet will live alongside it.

### Step-by-step

1. **Open the Ignite Market app.** Navigate to [https://ignitemarket.xyz](https://ignitemarket.xyz) and click **Log In**.
2. In the **Connect wallet** modal, click **Embedded Wallet** at the bottom of the list.
3. **Select your social account.** Choose Discord, Apple, Facebook, Google, Telegram, X, or Twitch.
4. **Authorize with the provider.** A pop-up will ask you to sign in and give Ignite Market limited permission to read your public profile (email & username). No posting rights are requested.
5. **Sign the registration message.** Just like with a browser wallet, sign the one-time, gas-free message to finish onboarding.
6. **You're ready!** Your new wallet address now appears in the nav bar. You can deposit, trade, and create markets instantly.

:::tip
Using an embedded wallet is ideal for newcomers who don't want to install a browser extension or manage seed phrases. You can always export the private key later if you decide to migrate to MetaMask.
