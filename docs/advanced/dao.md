The Ignite Token is central to governance and resolution for social and disputed automatic markets.

## Core Mechanism

- Governance token holders stake tokens to vote on subjective outcomes.
- Votes are weighted by token stake and a reputation score (earned from past correct resolutions).
- A supermajority (66%+) determines the outcome.

## Market fees

Market fees are set at 1% for every transaction (buy and sell). This can be adjusted via a DAO vote.

## Incentives

- **Correct Voters:** Earn 50% of market fees (in the marketâ€™s currency) plus a reputation boost.
- **Incorrect Voters:** Lose 10% of staked tokens (5% redistributed to winners, 5% burned).

## Anti-Manipulation

To prevent dishonest voting:

1. **Quadratic Voting:** Votes scale quadratically (e.g., 1 token = 1 vote, 4 tokens = 2 votes), reducing whale influence.
2. **Reputation System:**
   - Weights votes alongside tokens.
   - Sets minimum reputation thresholds for high-value markets.
   - Enhances Sybil resistance.
   - May involve a jury of high-reputation holders.

## Reputation system mechanics

TBD

## Airdrop

Ignite Tokens will be airdropped to participants based on a points system tied to:
- Market participation (bets placed)
- Referral program (users referred)
- Community engagement (market suggestions, resolution voting)

Details to be announced at a later stage.
